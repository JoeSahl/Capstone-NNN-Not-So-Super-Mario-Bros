--CONTROLS--

Left and Right: Arrow Keys
Jump: Spacebar
Sprint: Hold Shift
Shoot Fireball: F (After consuming fire flower)

--Notes--
Jump on top of enemies to kill them.
Fire flowers and mushrooms have a ~9% chance to generate from question blocks. Coins will generate ~82% of the time.
Koopa will retract into its shell when stomped. The shell can be kicked but can only be destroyed by a fireball!
Bowser's fireballs in the last level will shoot straight at you. Avoid them and wait for Bowser to jump.
The final level is beaten by getting past Bowser and grabbing the axe.

Score and coins reset completely upon death, but you restart the current level. This means that if you die on level 2,
your final score will not include anything that can be gained in level 1. Therefore, to achieve the maximum score, complete
the game from start to finish without dying!
