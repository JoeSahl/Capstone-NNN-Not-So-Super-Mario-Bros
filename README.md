--CONTROLS--<br/>

Left and Right: Arrow Keys<br/>
Jump: Spacebar<br/>
Sprint: Hold Shift<br/>
Shoot Fireball: F (After consuming fire flower)<br/>

--Notes--<br/>
Jump on top of enemies to kill them.<br/>
Fire flowers and mushrooms have a ~9% chance to generate from question blocks. Coins will generate ~82% of the time.<br/>
Koopa will retract into its shell when stomped. The shell can be kicked but can only be destroyed by a fireball!<br/>
Bowser's fireballs in the last level will shoot straight at you. Avoid them and wait for Bowser to jump.<br/>
The final level is beaten by getting past Bowser and grabbing the axe.<br/>

Score and coins reset completely upon death, but you restart the current level. This means that if you die on level 2,<br/>
your final score will not include anything that can be gained in level 1. Therefore, to achieve the maximum score, complete<br/>
the game from start to finish without dying!<br/>
